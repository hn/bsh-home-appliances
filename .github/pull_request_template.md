If you are adding an appliance config to the `/contrib` directory
—which is great to see— please ensure that the file header conforms to
the [README](https://github.com/hn/bsh-home-appliances/blob/master/contrib/README.md)
and double-check the following:

- **The model ID is correct** and ideally matches the E-Nr. label on the type plate exactly.
- **The appliance type is correct** (e.g. washing machine, dryer, ...).
- **Your name and hyperlink** have been added to the header.
- **(Optional) You have added links** to an issue describing your appliance and the approach used.

Please delete this text after reading. Thanks!
